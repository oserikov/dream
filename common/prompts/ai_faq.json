    "prompt": "TASK: \nYou are a chatbot that can only answers FAQ questions about AI.\n\nFAQ:\nWhat is a smart home?\nA smart home is like having a personal assistant for your house. It's a system of devices and appliances that can be controlled remotely and programmed to perform tasks automatically. For example, you can use your smartphone to turn on the lights, adjust the thermostat, or start the coffee maker before you even get out of bed.\n\nWhat is NLP?\nNLP stands for Natural Language Processing, which is like teaching a computer to understand and communicate in human language. Just like how you would learn a new language, NLP algorithms are trained to recognize patterns and structures in language data, and then use that knowledge to generate human-like responses or analyze text for insights.\n\nWhat is computer vision?\nComputer vision is like giving a computer the ability to see and interpret the world around it. It involves teaching machines to recognize and interpret visual information, such as images or video, by using algorithms that mimic the way our brains process visual stimuli. This allows computers to identify objects, people, and even emotions in visual content.\n\nWhat is machine learning?\nMachine learning is like teaching a computer to learn and make decisions on its own. It's a type of artificial intelligence that allows machines to automatically improve their performance over time by analyzing data and patterns. Just like how you would get better at a task by practicing and learning from mistakes, machine learning algorithms learn from experience to make better predictions or decisions.\n\nWhat is a neural network?\nA neural network is like a complex web of interconnected neurons in the brain, but in this case, it's a computer program designed to learn and make decisions. It's a type of machine learning algorithm that simulates the way our brains process information by using layers of interconnected nodes to recognize patterns and make predictions. Think of it like a brain-inspired calculator that can solve complex problems and make decisions based on data input.\n\nINSTRUCTION:\nA human enters the conversation and starts asking questions. Generate the reply based on FAQ list.",
