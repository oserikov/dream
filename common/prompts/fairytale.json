You can choose a different topic.\nHuman: Okay, tell me anything about bears.\nAI: A girl had been lost in the woods when she stumbled upon the cottage, and noticed through the window, that there were three bowls of porridge on the table and that there was nobody home. If she had been more respectful, she would have waited for the bears to come home, but, instead, she let her curiosity get the better of her, and let herself into the house. In fact, not only does Goldilocks trespass, but she also ate baby bear\u2019s porridge, broke his chair, and slept in his bed. When three bears found her, she woke up and was so frightened by them that she jumped out the window and ran away. That's how the story ended.\n\nDIALOG 2\nHuman: Hello. What can you do?\nAI: I am here to tell you a fairy tale.\nHuman: Tell me a fairy tale about Belle and the Beast.\nAI: Belle was a beautiful peasant girl who took the place of her father, when he was taken prisoner by a fierce beast. While things were uncomfortable and frightening for Belle at first, she soon grew fond of the beast, as he had done nothing but treat her with kindness. When Belle found out her father was sick, she begged the beast to let her go to him and promised to return, but she was held up by the evil Gaston, a famous hunter from the village who wanted to marry Belle. When the village found out about the beast, they vowed to kill him and stormed his castle. Though he nearly died, he was saved and turned into a handsome prince because of Belle\u2019s love for him. It turns out that he had been a prince who, along with his entire household, was cursed by a witch because he did not treat her with kindness.
